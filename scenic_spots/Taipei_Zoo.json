The insectarium was another fascinating section, showcasing unique bugs and butterflies.\n\nDespite the long hours we spent there, we couldn\u2019t cover every exhibit, which just means we\u2019ll have to visit again. The zoo is well-maintained, with plenty of shaded areas and resting spots, making it comfortable even on a warm day.\n\nThe Taipei Zoo is a must-visit for families and animal lovers. Plan for a full day, wear comfortable shoes, and enjoy a fantastic adventure!\n\nWould definitely return to see the rest!",

And they're mostly well maintained.\n\nThe zoo is huge. But walkable for people. There's a Tram to bring you from the the bottom to the top of the zoo. Most of the attractions still needs to locate by foot.\n\nNot forgetting to add, as an adult, I'm amazed of how educational this zoo is. Information of the animals could even be found in toilets.\n\nJust a pity, the Pandas wasn't in the exhibition when we were there.\n\nDidn't see the Tigers, Capybaras, Pangolins too.

You could easily spend an entire day wandering through all the different sections and still feel like you've missed a bunch. It's the kind of place where you keep thinking you've seen it all, and then you turn a corner and there's another whole area to explore. And the fact that it doesn't break the bank to get in? That's just a huge bonus. You get so much bang for your buck.\nBut the real magic for me was finally standing in front of animals I've only ever seen in books or on a screen. You know, those animals that feel almost mythical until you see them with your own eyes. The rhinoceroses were just these incredible, powerful-looking creatures, like something out of prehistory. And the elephants? Their sheer size is breathtaking, but there's also this calm, intelligent look in their eyes that's really something. Then there were the hippos, these huge, almost comical-looking things lounging in the water. It's hard to describe the feeling of actually seeing them \u2013 it's like your imagination suddenly becomes real. They're not just pictures; they're living, breathing beings, and you're right there, watching them. It gives you this whole new level of appreciation for how amazing the natural world is.\nHonestly, trying to cram it all into one day felt like a race against the clock. Every time I thought I was ready to move on, I'd spot another path leading to a new exhibit and think, \"Just a quick peek!\" Next thing I knew, another hour had gone by. There's just so much to take in. I left feeling like I'd seen a lot, but also knowing there was so much more waiting to be discovered. I'm already mentally planning my return trip, figuring out which sections I want to spend more time in. If you're ever anywhere near Taipei, making a trip to this zoo should be high on your list. It's not just a way to kill time; it's a genuine adventure and a chance to connect with some truly incredible animals. Trust me, it's an experience you won't forget.",
